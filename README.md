# Galler.ia

Lin Ochoa, Andres Gajardo, Frankie Ta 

Galler.ia is a website dedicated to give you the best slide shows. Photographers or any other artists can use it to showcase their work. Viewers can turn their devices into live picture frames so long as it is connected to the internet and can run a browser. Galler.ia would be considered as a content creation and distribution platform. 

The inspiration came from wanting to turn a computer screen into a live picture frame but not being able to find a good website that can do this. 

At the moment everyone has their own way of setting up background visuals. With our site we plan to make it easier for anyone looking to display visual content. The content could be photos of family events, adventures, landscapes, and macro shots. This would be a free service for the smaller accounts, and a paid service for the premium accounts.

Similar applications are PhotoSnack.com. This site was more dedicated to sharing photos with friends on different social media platform. Another application is imgur.com but they focus on viral images.

Our idea differs because we are trying to enable any screen to be a picture frame.

Users:
	
1. Slide show creators - these people create galleries and show case their images. 

2. Viewers - These people have a screen that they want to turn into a picture frame so they can consume the content

3. Moderators - people that remove or flag inappropriate content.

4. Editors - people that pick images that go to the front page

Usecases:

1. Stella wants to display background images in her home but doesn't have photos that she wants to display. Lucky for her she has an old computer that she doesn't use. Stella can use this computer as a picture frame and use Galler.ia to display background visuals. With Galler.ia Stella has a plethora of photos to display.

2. Lenny is a photographer who is looking to build his reputation. He can post to Galler.ia and gain an audience. If his audience is pleased with his work they can fund him directly.
